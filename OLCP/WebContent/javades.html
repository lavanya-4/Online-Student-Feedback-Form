        <h2><center><b><u>Java</u></b></center></h2><br>
        When the chronicle of computer languages is written, the following will be said: B led to
C, C evolved into C++, and C++ set the stage for Java. To understand Java is to
understand the reasons that drove its creation, the forces that shaped it, and the legacy
that it inherits. Like the successful computer languages that came before, Java is a blend
of the best elements of its rich heritage combined with the innovative concepts required
by its unique environment. While the remaining chapters of this book describe the
practical aspects of Java—including its syntax, libraries, and applications—in this
chapter, you will learn how and why Java came about, and what makes it so important.
Although Java has become inseparably linked with the online environment of the Internet,
it is important to remember that Java is first and foremost a programming language.
Computer language innovation and development occurs for two fundamental reasons:<br>
• To adapt to changing environments and uses<br>
• To implement refinements and improvements in the art of programming<br>
As you will see, the creation of Java was driven by both elements in nearly equal
measure.<br>
<b>Why Java Is Important to the Internet</b><br>
The Internet helped catapult Java to the forefront of programming, and Java, in turn, has
had a profound effect on the Internet. The reason for this is quite simple: Java expands
the universe of objects that can move about freely in cyberspace. In a network, two very
broad categories of objects are transmitted between the server and your personal
computer: passive information and dynamic, active programs. For example, when you
read your e-mail, you are viewing passive data. Even when you download a program, the
program's code is still only passive data until you execute it. However, a second type of
object can be transmitted to your computer: a dynamic, self-executing program. Such a
program is an active agent on the client computer, yet is initiated by the server. For
example, a program might be provided by the server to display properly the data that the
server is sending.
As desirable as dynamic, networked programs are, they also present serious problems in
the areas of security and portability. Prior to Java, cyberspace was effectively closed to
half the entities that now live there. As you will see, Java addresses those concerns and,
by doing so, has opened the door to an exciting new form of program: the applet.
<br><b>Java Appletsand Applications</b><br>
Java can be used to create two types of programs: applications and applets. An
application is a program that runs on your computer, under the operating system of that
computer. That is, an application created by Java is more or less like one created using C
or C++. When used to create applications, Java is not much different from any other
computer language. Rather, it is Java's ability to create applets that makes it important.
An applet is an application designed to be transmitted over the Internet and executed by
a Java-compatible Web browser. An applet is actually a tiny Java program, dynamically
downloaded across the network, just like an image, sound file, or video clip. The
important difference is that an applet is an intelligent program, not just an animation or
media file. In other words, an applet is a program that can react to user input and
dynamically change—not just run the same animation or sound over and over.
As exciting as applets are, they would be nothing more than wishful thinking if Java were
not able to address the two fundamental problems associated with them: security and
portability. Before continuing, let's define what these two terms mean relative to the
Internet.<br>
<b>Security</b><br>
As you are likely aware, every time that you download a "normal" program, you are
risking a viral infection. Prior to Java, most users did not download executable programs
frequently, and those who did scanned them for viruses prior to execution. Even so, most
users still worried about the possibility of infecting their systems with a virus. In addition
to viruses, another type of malicious program exists that must be guarded against. This
type of program can gather private information, such as credit card numbers, bank
account balances, and passwords, by searching the contents of your computer's local file
system. Java answers both of these concerns by providing a "firewall" between a
networked application and your computer.
When you use a Java-compatible Web browser, you can safely download Java applets
without fear of viral infection or malicious intent. Java achieves this protection by
confining a Java program to the Java execution environment and not allowing it access to
other parts of the computer. (You will see how this is accomplished shortly.) The ability to
download applets with confidence that no harm will be done and that no security will be
breached is considered by many to be the single most important aspect of Java.
<b>Portability</b><br>
As discussed earlier, many types of computers and operating systems are in use
throughout the world—and many are connected to the Internet. For programs to be
dynamically downloaded to all the various types of platforms connected to the Internet,
some means of generating portable executable code is needed. As you will soon see, the
same mechanism that helps ensure security also helps create portability. Indeed, Java's
solution to these two problems is both elegant and efficient.
